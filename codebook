about the raw data:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers 
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 
3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have 
been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has
been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was 
selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Task performed on the data

We have extracted only mean and standard deviation
for each mesurement. 
We calculate the mean of these mesurement by subjet 
and by activity.
So the values contain in the tidy_data are the average of 
mean and standard deviation for each couple of subject and
activity

Variables are about time and frequency domain. That's 
indicated in the names of variables by "Fromtime" and "frequency"



1 subject_id : number that identify the subject involve in the study.
               There are thirty personns so the number is from 1 to 30
            
2 activity   : name of the activity perform in the study. there are 
               six activities
            1  WALKING  
            2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS   
            3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
            4 SITTING  
            5 STANDING
            6 LAYING
